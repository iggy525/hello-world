# H1 *Hello all, welcome to my coding journey* 
## H2 My name is **Nigel**, I am a 24 year old soon-to-be dad in Southern California. I currently work as a Warehouse manager, but after being diagnosed with an Auto-Immune disease, am looking for a career that is less physically stressful on my body. I have always been interested in computers, and my amazing Brother-in-Law sparked my interest in the world of coding.
### H3 I have no idea what I am doing at this point, but I am excited to see where this takes me! ðŸ˜„
